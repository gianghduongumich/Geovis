# Hello! 
I'm Huong Giang Duong. Iâ€™m a student specializing in Geospatial Data Science. This website showcases my projects and assignments for the Geovisualisation (EAS 648) course.

Welcome to my personal site. This homepage is written in **R Markdown** and will be published on **GitHub Pages**.

- I am interested in: _urban planning, climate change, and sustainability_.
- This site will grow as I add more `.Rmd` analyses under **Analyses**.
